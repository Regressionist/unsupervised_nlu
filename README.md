# Unsupervised POS tagging

This repository is the implementation of the unsupervised POS tagging system as described in ___. This work is based on unsupervised NER task by using KALM https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04458.

## Scripts
a) data_analysis_baseline.ipynb - this notebook implements loading, preprocessing and analysis on Penn Treebank WSJ corpus. Also, this notebook implements and evaluate
baseline model which tags a token based on the majority class.  
b) Base LSTM model.ipynb - this notebook implements simple vanilla LTSM model for autoregressive modeling using KALM.
